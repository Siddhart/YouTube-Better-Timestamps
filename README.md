# YouTube Better Timestamps
## Description
With this extension you can click on the YouTube timestamp to see how much time is left of the video. You can also use the shortcuts to skip to the next or previous chapter.

## Why did I build this?
YouTube mobile has this really usefull feature where you can click on the timestamp to see how much time is left of the video you are watching. I was pretty disappointed when I noticed that YouTube on desktop didn't have this feature. 
Thats when I realized that I could build my own extension and.... here we are :D

## How do you use it?
You simply download the latest stable version as a .zip file. Then you will need to unpack this and go to the extensions manager page in your browser. On this page you will ahve to enable devloper mode and choose "use unpacked folder". Select the folder with the contents and u are ready to go!

## How can I contribute to this project?
Before you start working on a feature or fix open a issue. After that fork the project and change anything you want. I will review the pull request and merge it to the main branch.
