With this extension you can click on the YouTube timestamp to see how much time is left on the video. You can also use the shortcuts to skip to the next or previous chapter.

## Why did I build this?
YouTube mobile has this really usefull feature where you can click on the timestamp to see how much time is left of the video you are watching. I was pretty disappointed when i noticed that YouTube on desktop didn' thave this feature. 
Thats when I realized that I could code my own extension and.... here we are :D
